# Cheese; [Getting Start]
Just a simple bit of my introduction,,
Apparently, there's more than a thousand of GitHub users in Pony Town and it seems cool-
So, pardon if there's almost nothing interesting in my page because this is my first time using GitHub. In addition to that, I'm still learning the fundamentals of GitHub anyway T T

For those that read this through my Pony Town or any other social media, thank you very much! I appreciate the time you spend just to read this.
