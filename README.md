# Cheese; [Getting Start]
Just a simple bit of my introduction,,
Apparently, there's more than a thousand of GitHub users in Pony Town and it seems cool-
So, pardon if there's almost nothing interesting in my page because this is my first time using GitHub. In addition to that, I'm still learning the fundamentals of GitHub anyway T T

For those that read this through my Pony Town or any other social media, thank you very much! I appreciate the time you spend just to read this.

For any enquiries, feel free to interact me! Though if I have 'offtab' on my name, it's best to w2i [whisper to interact] until I'm online again. Staying around me is not encouraged because I might took hours!

Anyway, it's time to introduce myself better :]. By now, you should already know I goes by the name Cheese [2 account, yes.] I am desperate to connect these two accounts of mine but failed to do so. Reaching for Pony Town's developers team seems awkward for me to do TT. Pardon for sidetracked,., I am not good when it comes to proper introduction but I might as well tell you what fandoms I'm in.

Honestly, I am a multifandom myself. Though my genre is specifically into horror, dark psychology, something disturbing [be it mentally or physically], and [my favourite] gore. Basically, I know— SCP, Creepypasta, Doctor Nowhere's creature, Trevor Henderson's creature, Madness Combat, Mandela Catalogue, Dead by Daylight, any slasher movies, Slenderverse, FNAF,  etc.
